                        Hello! My name is Jessica and I'm currently a second year Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University. While I'm still learning how software development works, I really enjoy solving problems with code and the aha moments that come with it.

                    <p>
                        Outside of school and coding, most of my free time is spent reading, watching anime, listening to music, and playing games. If you're curious about anything related to these interests, don't worry! I'll talk more about them later.
