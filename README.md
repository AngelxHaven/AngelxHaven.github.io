# AngelxHaven.github.io
This is a repository used to create a Github pages website for my CMPT276 solo mini project. This info may or may not change in the future to reflect new uses of the repo.

# Summary
The website contains a short introduction followed by links to some projects, links to some recommendations related to my interests, and finally links to my social media. All these different sections can be quickly accessed from both the navbar at the top and the footer at the bottom.

# License Choice
This repo uses a MIT license as some of styling is inspired from other website, while some is written by AI. Due to these two reasons, I feel a MIT license is appropriate as others should be able to use aspects of my website in their own however they want, without needing to worry about copyright.
