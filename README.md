# AngelxHaven.github.io
This is a repository used to create a Github pages website for my CMPT276 solo mini project. This info may or may not change in the future to reflect new uses of the repo.

# Summary
The website contains a short introduction followed by links to some projects, links to some recommendations related to my interests, and finally links to my social media. All these different sections can be quickly accessed from both the navbar at the top and the footer at the bottom.
